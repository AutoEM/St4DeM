# St4DeM
4D-STEM acquisition/visualization software including EELS/EDS SI and tomography
(pronounced as St. 4D EM...)

St4DeM is a multi-modal 4D-STEM data acquisition software written within the Digital Micrograph (DM) environment. It can acquire 4D-STEM data, as well as EELS and EDS spectrum images. A Thermo Fisher/JEOL wrapper function libraries are included for microscope control. It has bindings to the AutoEM software for collecting montage image series of unlimited number of nanoparticles for particle size distribution calculations. It can also acquire momentum resolved EELS spectra and normal STEM tilt series for tomographic reconstruction coupled with 4D-STEM and EELS/EDS SI. It also provides basic visualization of 4D data e.g. virtual imaging and integrated DPC.

It has been tested with JEOL 2100F (Stockholm), JEOL 2100F (Trondheim), aberration corrected Thermo Fisher 300kv Themis. Supported DM versions 2 and 3.
Tested cameras include UltraScan, Oneview, ...

Here only Jupyter notebooks and some useful DM scripts for 4D/6D data manipulation and analysis are provided.
